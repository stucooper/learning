Ideas and thoughts from Manning Publications Emails
===================================================
book summaries, etc
A lot of these are unfinished MEAPS:
MEAP = Manning Early Access Program; 3/4-finished books.
which say they will become full books later; this doesn't always
happen (did I have a 3/4 finished O'Reilly puppet book back in the
day?)

Shrek released in 2001: tried to be a blend of CGI and real action
but looked terrible so went fully CGI

book shows you how to spot, understand, and respond to latency
wherever it appears in your applications and infrastructure.
